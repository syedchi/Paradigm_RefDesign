# Paradigm's AWS Reference Architecture

## Overview
This architecture depicts how Paradigm's clinical research platform integrates with AWS cloud infrastructure, third-party SaaS providers, and the on-premise corporate data center. It emphasizes secure data sharing, scalability, compliance, and integration with cloud-native services like Amazon RDS, EC2, and EKS. 

### 1. **Corporate Data Center**:
- The corporate data center represents Paradigm’s on-premise infrastructure, which connects to AWS via **AWS Direct Connect** and **AWS Transit Gateway** for high-speed, low-latency communication with AWS cloud environments.
- This allows Paradigm to link its clinical trial management systems, databases, and other healthcare-related infrastructure with AWS while maintaining a dedicated, secure connection.

### 2. **Customer VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**:
- The **Customer VPC** is Paradigm’s private cloud environment in AWS, consisting of multiple subnets:
  - **Private Subnet 1** hosts the **EC2 Compute Instances** running mission-critical applications.
  - **Private Subnet 2** is dedicated to the **Amazon EKS Cluster** for containerized workloads (e.g., microservices supporting clinical data management).
  - **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)** and **Amazon Redshift** provide relational and data warehousing services for structured and analytics workloads respectively.
  - **Amazon S3** is used for data storage (e.g., research data, logs), while **Amazon SNS** manages notifications and alerts for event-driven applications.
  
### 3. **Security and Monitoring**:
- **Security Groups** are applied to control inbound and outbound traffic within the VPC, ensuring that only authorized services and users can access specific resources.
- **Amazon CloudWatch** is integrated into the architecture to provide real-time monitoring, log aggregation, and performance metrics for both application and infrastructure health.
- **AWS CloudTrail** logs all API activities and data-sharing operations to ensure compliance with healthcare regulations (e.g., HIPAA) and auditing requirements.

### 4. **SaaS Providers Integration**:
- Paradigm integrates with third-party **SaaS Providers** through a **SaaS Bridge Account**. This enables secure communication between Paradigm’s infrastructure and external applications that may support clinical trials or patient data management.
  - **SaaS Provider 1** operates its own VPC, hosting a specific SaaS application.
  - **SaaS Provider 2** also has a VPC and utilizes **Amazon DynamoDB** as its data store, allowing for dynamic and scalable database operations for handling large volumes of clinical data.
- Data is shared between Paradigm and SaaS providers via secure **VPC-to-VPC peering** and **IAM Role-based access**.

### 5. **Transit Gateway and AWS Direct Connect**:
- **AWS Direct Connect** ensures a secure, dedicated connection between Paradigm’s on-premise data center and its AWS cloud infrastructure, providing lower latency and more reliable connectivity compared to standard internet connections.
- **AWS Transit Gateway** acts as a hub for communication between multiple VPCs within Paradigm’s AWS environment and SaaS providers. It simplifies network architecture by centralizing traffic routing and interconnectivity across multiple AWS accounts.

### 6. **Compliance and Audit**:
- **AWS CloudTrail** logs all API calls and provides visibility into actions taken on both AWS and SaaS environments. This is critical for ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations, especially for managing sensitive clinical data.
- **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)** is integrated for encryption and secure key management to ensure that all data at rest and in transit is securely encrypted.

### **Key AWS Services Used**:
- **Amazon EC2**: Provides scalable compute resources to run Paradigm’s applications.
- **Amazon EKS**: Orchestrates containerized applications for efficient and scalable microservices.
- **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)**: Manages relational data, especially for clinical research records.
- **Amazon Redshift**: Data warehousing for analytics and large-scale querying.
- **Amazon S3**: Object storage for research data, clinical trial documents, and log files.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitors application and infrastructure performance.
- **Amazon CloudTrail**: Audits and logs API activity to ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks.
- **Amazon SNS**: Manages notifications for alerting systems.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database used by SaaS providers for fast, scalable data management.

### **Security Considerations**:
- **IAM Roles**: Provide granular permissions and ensure secure access between different AWS services and SaaS providers.
- **Security Groups**: Regulate network access within the VPC to prevent unauthorized traffic.
- **AWS KMS**: Encrypts sensitive clinical data and manages secure keys for encryption at rest and in transit.

### **Conclusion**:
This architectur des a highly secure, scalable, and compliant platform for Paradigm’s clinical research operations, integrating both internal and third-party resources seamlessly. It allows Paradigm to manage clinical data efficiently while maintaining the flexibility to scale operations globally and ensuring compliance with stringent healthcare regulations.
